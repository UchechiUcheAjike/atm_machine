# Overview

{I am trying to familarize myself with the C++ programming language so that I can be an all round software developer}

{I wrote an ATM software. It takes deposit input from the user, store the deposit and returns it as the balance. it also adds and withdraws from the users account depending on what the user wants.}

{I wrote this software to familarize myself with the C++ programming language and its development environment}

# Development Environment

{I used CLion from JetBrains which installed the MinGW compiler automatically on my system to enable me to use the text editor.}

{I also used the C++ language which is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development. It is based on the C language. C++ requires the use of a compiler and linker, which are operating system– and processor-specific.}
