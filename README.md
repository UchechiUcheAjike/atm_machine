# Development Environment

{CLion from JetBrains which installed the MinGW compiler automatically on my system to enable me to use the text editor.}

{The C++ language is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development. It is based on the C language. C++ requires the use of a compiler and linker, which are operating systemâ€“ and processor-specific.}
